# TIME-MCE-Files
This repository holds the files necessary to make a complete working duplicate of the mce software, and should be used as a backup in case of file deletion or corruption. Compiling from scratch is still recommended. Other files necessary for working on inter-device communication with the MCE will also be included, including those needed for GUI software development.
